## [GDR-22](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/request-for-information-about-disputes-gdr-22/6278)

Disputing indexer `0xc55c63563efb36f7cc65ac3060c52987c6694b37` on allocation id `0x13722734f9ef698b1a4774922ecd16cde778ca7b`.

The POI `0xa3da80a275bf91366181a60c6763835070c914fc171e09e54234c3303c572729` was used for a third time:

The subgraph state is healthy:

Other indexers active on the same subgraph in this time period have correctly submitted non-duplicate POIs on this healthy subgraph:

**Could the indexer please provide information as to why the POI was used repeatedly during the time period from November 24 to December 4?**


## [GDR-23](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/request-for-information-about-disputes-gdr-23/6279)

Disputing indexer `0xe13840a2e92e0cb17a246609b432d0fa2e418774` on allocation id `0x6e4cb16d9b519056ded7271330f44bff3b21d82f`.

The POI `0xa5130d48a714d22733f90426f3503c84deb22a1132f395a49125efa5081c4252` was used for the seventh time:
<img width="1201" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e432ecf-0049-4579-a8be-7de48a5cdf34" />

The indexer submitted 20 POIs that were not duplicate prior to that point. However starting in August through December the same POI has been repeated seven times.

The subgraph is in a healthy and synced state for 5 indexers:

The upgrade indexer and streamingfast have encountered errors, but other indexers active on the same subgraph in this time period have correctly submitted at least 35 non-duplicate POIs on this healthy subgraph, and no other indexer has ever submitted a duplicate POI on the subgraph:

**Could the indexer provide more information around why they repeatedly closed allocations with a duplicate POI despite no other indexer doing so on this subgraph?**
